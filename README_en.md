## Purpose of the web application 

This web application allows users to keep track of their daily water consumption. 
It allows you to set goals for the amount of water you need to drink per day, 
and monitor their progress. 

In addition, Water Tracker provides useful tips on how to balance your water intake 
and the ability to set reminders to help you stay on track with your water intake.

## What technologies were used

Modern web development technologies were used in the development of this project. 
For the backend, we used Node.js along with the Express framework,
which allows you to quickly create scalable and reliable applications. 
The CORS library was used to ensure security and compliance with CORS policies.

In the front-end, JavaScript and the React library were used to create the user interface and user interaction logic. 
Styled Components were used to stylise components. 
The react-hook-form library was used for convenient form management and validation.

Redux was used for the global state of the application, 
which made it possible to store and manage the application state conveniently and efficiently. 
The use of these technologies allowed us to ensure efficient and convenient development of Water Tracker.
